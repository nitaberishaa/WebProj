                A beauty salon, is an establishment dealing with cosmetic treatments for men and women. There's a difference between a beauty 
                salon and a beauty parlor which is that a beauty salon is a well developed space in a private location, 
                usually having more features than a beauty parlor could have. Usually a beauty parlor concentrates on a specific 
                treatment or beauty features such as styling either for men, women or for both. 
                <br><br>Also, a beauty parlor is a smaller and more community friendly place which is usually located at the owner's home.
                 In some cases the owner is not only the boss, but probably the only worker, not having any other crew members. Other variations
                  of this type of business include hair salons and spas.There is a distinction between a beauty salon and a hair salon and 
                 although many small businesses do offer both sets of treatments; beauty salons provide extended services related to skin health, 
                 facial aesthetics, foot care, nail manicures, aromatherapy â€” even meditation, oxygen therapy, mud baths and many other services.
