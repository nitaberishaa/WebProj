           <p>At KORA Organics, we believe that healthy skin is the most beautiful skin.
            <br><br>Our skin is our largest organ and it supports the life of all our other body parts.
             It plays a vital role in maintaining our immune system and works 24/7 to take care of us, protect us and keep us healthy. 
             It makes sense to look after our skin with products that replenish it and fill it with the nutrients it needs to function at its best.
            As an international model, mother and someone who is passionate about nutrition, health and wellbeing, having healthy skin has been 
            important to me from a young age. In 2006 I started the development of KORA Organics – a company I founded on the values of making a 
            transformative difference to people’s skin, their confidence, and offering them a healthier
             alternative to other brands on the market.<br><br> We use certified organic and natural products for one simple reason – because what you put
              on your skin soaks in
            Along with a team of researchers and consultants in microbiology, aromatherapy and organic chemistry who specialise in organic and natural
            
            formulations, I identified key ingredients based on their natural healing and protective powers, such as Noni Extract, Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil and Green Tea.
            KORA Organics launched in 2009 exclusively through Australia’s leading department store, David Jones and . Since then, KORA Organics has expanded to over 200 retailers across Australia, including Sephora and in 2017, launched exclusively in the U.S.A in over 300 Sephora stores and Sephora.com. Today,the award-winning range is now also stocked globally across 30 countries, including; United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
            We have created an award-winning range of certified organic and certified natural products that detoxify, nourish and revitalise your skin. KORA Organics products are highly concentrated and active, delivering visible results while restoring your skin to its optimal health. We love what we have created and we’re excited for you to experience our products. </p>
